Shootstrap
==========

Lets you apply bootstrap css on selected divs like a boss:

```
  <div class="shoot">
    <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
  </div>
  
  <div class="">
    <h1>No Bootstrap</h1>
  </div>
```

Often, this is a life saver. For instance in case of the excellent [Google Chart Editor](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/drawing_charts?hl=fr#charteditor) that gets totally messed up on any page with bootstrap in it.

This project is a fork of [Twitter's Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/).

Have fun.
